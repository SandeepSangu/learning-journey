# Waterfall Model 💧

The Waterfall model is a `linear` and `sequential` approach to software development where each phase must be completed before the next one begins. This means that each phase depends on the previous one, and making changes or revisions later can be difficult and costly.

## Phases 📅

The phases of the Waterfall model are the same as those in the SDLC, with a strong emphasis on their sequential nature.

## Example 🍰

Imagine ordering a custom cake. You first give the bakery your order (`requirements`), then they design the cake (`design`), followed by baking and decorating (`implementation`), tasting and quality control (`testing`), and finally, delivering the cake to you (`deployment`). If you want to change the cake's flavor or design after it's been baked, it's too late and would require starting over from scratch.

## Advantages ✅

- **Simplicity and Ease of Use**: The linear nature makes it straightforward.
- **Clear Milestones and Deliverables**: Each phase has specific goals and outputs.

## Disadvantages ❌

- **Inflexibility in Handling Changes**: Difficult to make changes once a phase is completed.
- **Difficulty in Accommodating New Requirements**: New requirements are hard to integrate mid-process.
